    <h1>ðŸš€ Hello from GitHub Pages!</h1>
    <p>Myself <strong>Gnana Jothi</strong></p>
    <p>
        I am a passionate <strong>Junior DevOps Engineer</strong> with hands-on experience in
        cloud platforms, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and automation tools.
        Iâ€™ve completed certifications and projects in <strong>AWS, Python, Jenkins, Docker, Terraform,</strong> 
        and <strong>GitHub Actions</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to design efficient, secure, and scalable systems that bridge the gap 
        between development and operations. Always eager to learn and explore new technologies!
